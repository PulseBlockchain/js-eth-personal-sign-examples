# Experimenting with using app instantiated web3js 1.x API 

## Goals
- Signing with [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) but using webjs 1.x beta APIs like:
    - `web3.personal.sign` as discussed [here](https://programtheblockchain.com/posts/2018/02/17/signing-and-verifying-messages-in-ethereum/)
    - `web3.eth.signTypedData` as discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/712)
- WebSocket based event subscriptions as discussed [here](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/pull/5458)
- Move this to the more end-end [signing and verification test](https://github.com/sidsverma/eth_signTypedData-example) by @sidsverma 

[Live Demo Here](https://deploy-jnlivbghmr.now.sh) . Not functional yet.
